# Fake-news
This project aims to detect fake news articles using a DistilBERT-based model. The model is trained on the WELFake Dataset and can classify news articles as real or fake. Additionally, a Flask web application is provided to allow users to check any article from the internet.

# Key Features 
1. DistilBERT Model: Utilizes a pre-trained DistilBERT model fine-tuned for fake news detection.
2. Data Preprocessing: Includes scripts to preprocess the WELFake Dataset.
3. Training and Evaluation: Code to train the model and evaluate its performance on a test set.
4. Flask Web App: A web application to predict the authenticity of any news article by providing its URL.
